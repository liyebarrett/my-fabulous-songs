# Beats by Liye
> In this project, I used creative coding then furthered it to creative coding in music. I coded three three-minute songs through the TunePad program and used loops, functions, and conditionals - some common programming techniques - to shape musical elements, such as rhythm, melody, and harmony. All of this, I kept a project journal, noting how different structures in code may affect how a song sounds. I watched loops create rhythms and functions stack harmonies, forming fuller compositions. Resources from TunePad to class materials connected the programming to music theory so I could adjust timing and pitch to refine each piece.

## Project Status
Project is: Finished. Completed Assignment 2 for Working with Data and Code

## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- Refine syncopation patterns for greater rhythmic precision
- Enhance modularity by further separating code sections for easier adjustments
- Experiment with more complex harmonies to add depth
- Adjust dynamics to create smoother transitions between sections
- Optimize code for efficiency, particularly in loop structures
- Improve timing on arpeggios to make sections feel more cohesive
- Refine note lengths to better convey intended emotions

To do:
- Implement additional instrument sounds to expand tonal variety
- Add a feature to adjust tempo dynamically within the code
- Create custom functions for common patterns to streamline future coding
- Experiment with polyphonic melodies for more layered compositions
- Add more interactive elements, like tempo sliders or sound adjustments
- Develop more complex rhythmic variations to add complexity to arrangements
- Test and fine-tune each section for balanced, expressive output
